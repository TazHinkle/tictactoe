## Challenge
Using the same applyStateFromUrlHash mindset and technique that we used on your Monster tables...
Program Tic-Tac-Toe.
var gameStateString = 'xox-x---o';
var cells = gameStateString.split('');
Your game state doesn't need to be any more complex than a 9-char string. :wink:
And splitting it by an empty string gets you an array of one char at a time!

## My comments
[x] - I need to come up with a board, then decide how fancy I'm getting with 'clickable'ness.

[x] - Make a game over state

[x] - Make opponent squares non-clickable.
